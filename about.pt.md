Hello!

I am Rodrigo Morais a Software Engineer from [Babbel](https://www.babbel.com) and I would like share with you my experiences and what I am doing in this Blog.

I am from Brazil but I just moved to Berlin.
I have 19 year working with software development and I am passionate for that.

I started my carreer working with VB6 and SQL Server building an ERP to civil construction companies.
In 2003 when [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) was lauched and after some experience with [ASP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa286483.aspx) I started my adventure with Web development. In all these time I had the oportunity to work with different plataforms and languages as [Java](https://www.java.com) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). Currently my main language and environment is [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) which I have been working in front-end and back-end. I have been working with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to build services using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and with different frameworks as [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) to create front-end projects.

Lately my interests are [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and I will talk a lot about those subjects here.

I hope you like the discussions which we will have here and that we can share as much knwoledge as possible.


Thank you!
